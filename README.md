# Hudello Coding Challenge: SQL

Welcome to our SQL coding challenge. In this exercise, you'll develop 2 SQL queries using the included SQLite database:
- Find the average grade of each `course`.
  ```
  course|average
  Arithmetic|2.67
  Biology|1.25
  ```
- Find the percentage of students with more than **one** course completed in each school.
  ```
  school_id|percentage
  123|33.33
  456|100
  ```

You may use subqueries and joins, but you cannot use more than 1 query for each of the above.

To get started:
1. Fork or clone this repo.
2. Implement your code.
3. Send us a link to your repo for review.

Happy coding!
